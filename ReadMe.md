# Minecraft SERVER STATUS CHECK DM VER
 Tired of starting your minecraft, only to find your favorite server is turned off? 
 This code has you covered! This checks if your server is up and running, and dms you if so!
 This version of the code dms the specified user on server start. There is a version for servers on another of my Github repositories.
